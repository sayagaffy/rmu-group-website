## 📊 Recharts Analysis & Recommendation

### Current Recharts Usage
The homepage uses **4 interactive Recharts components** in the Data Showcase section:

1. **GlobalEVSalesChart** ([src/components/charts/GlobalEVSalesChart.tsx](src/components/charts/GlobalEVSalesChart.tsx))
   - Type: Composed Chart (Stacked Bars + Line)
   - Shows: Global EV sales by region (China, Europe, US, Rest of World)
   - Interactive: Tooltips, Legend, Responsive

2. **EVBatteryMarketChart** ([src/components/charts/EVBatteryMarketChart.tsx](src/components/charts/EVBatteryMarketChart.tsx))
   - Type: Bar Chart
   - Shows: EV battery market growth projection
   - Interactive: Tooltips, Responsive

3. **BatteryDemandChart** ([src/components/charts/BatteryDemandChart.tsx](src/components/charts/BatteryDemandChart.tsx))
   - Type: Area Chart
   - Shows: Regional battery demand trends
   - Interactive: Tooltips, Responsive

4. **NickelReservesChart** ([src/components/charts/NickelReservesChart.tsx](src/components/charts/NickelReservesChart.tsx))
   - Type: Pie Chart
   - Shows: Global nickel reserves distribution (Indonesia: 42%)
   - Interactive: Tooltips, Custom Labels

### 🎯 Recommendation: KEEP RECHARTS

**Reasons to Keep Recharts:**

#### ✅ Advantages:
1. **Interactivity** - Users can hover for detailed data, zoom, and explore
2. **Responsiveness** - Charts automatically adapt to screen sizes
3. **Accessibility** - Better screen reader support than static images
4. **File Size** - Smaller bundle size than high-res PNG/JPG images
5. **Maintainability** - Easy to update data without redesigning images
6. **Professional** - Clean, modern data visualization
7. **SEO** - Data is indexable, unlike images
8. **Performance** - Charts render efficiently, lazy-load friendly

#### ❌ Disadvantages of Replacing with Images:
1. **Loss of Interactivity** - No tooltips, no data exploration
2. **Larger File Sizes** - 4 high-res charts = 800 KB+ vs. Recharts bundle
3. **Maintenance Burden** - Must recreate images for every data update
4. **Scaling Issues** - Images don't adapt as gracefully to all screen sizes
5. **Accessibility** - Alt text doesn't provide same data richness
6. **Design Consistency** - Harder to maintain consistent styling

### Alternative: Enhance Existing Recharts
Instead of replacing, consider:
1. ✅ Keep current Recharts implementation
2. Add loading skeletons for better UX
3. Optimize chart colors for brand consistency
4. Add export options (PNG/CSV) if users need static versions
5. Implement print-friendly CSS for PDF generation

### When to Use Images Instead:
- If you have professional infographic designs ready
- If interactivity is not important
- If you need to match specific brand style guides
- If charts are updated very infrequently (< 1x/year)
